### Newbies

We tag bugs in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA) with "newbie" that are good for people getting started with the code base. You can find the list [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SAMZA%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open).

### Larger Chunks of Work

More meaty projects are [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SAMZA%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20project%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open). The process for working on a large project is:

1. Instigate discussion on the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA).
2. Write a [design document](design-documents.html).
3. Request feedback for the [design document](design-documents.html) on the Jira and the samza-dev mailing list.
4. Come to an agreement on design.
5. Implement design.
